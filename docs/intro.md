# Intro

NixBlitz simplifies the process of deploying personal Bitcoin nodes on diverse hardware configurations, leveraging Nix, NixOS and nix-bitcoin.

Key Technologies powering NixBlitz:

- [Nix](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/): A robust package manager and build system for reproducible builds
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/): A Linux distribution that enables declarative and reproducible system configurations
- [nix-bitcoin](https://nixbitcoin.org/): A curated collection of Nix packages and NixOS modules designed to securely deploy Bitcoin nodes

:::info
The NixBlitz Project is currently in its research phase, and as such, it may undergo significant changes to both its codebase and system configuration. This means that configurations generated via the CLI may become incompatible at some point. Managing the config manually will always work, though.
